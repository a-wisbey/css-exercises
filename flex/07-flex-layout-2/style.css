/* HINTS
- You will need to change the flex-direction to push the footer down.
- You will need to add some divs as containers to get things to line up correctly.
- `flex-wrap` will help get the cards aligned correctly.
-  Make sure you define how much space the cards should take up, in order for `flex-wrap` to work as intended.

### Self Check
YES - The header text is size 32px and weight 900.
YES - The header text is vertically centered and 16px from the edge of the screen.
- The footer is pushed to the bottom of the screen (the footer may go _below_ the bottom of the screen if the content of the 'cards' section overflows and/or if your screen is shorter).
YES - The footer text is centered horizontally and vertically.
- The sidebar and cards take up all available space above the footer.
YES - The sidebar is 300px wide (and it doesn't shrink).
YES - The sidebar links are size 24px, are white, and do not have the underline text decoration.
YES - The sidebar has 16px padding.
YES - There is 32px padding around the 'cards' section.
- The cards are arranged horizontally, but wrap to multiple lines when they run out of room on the page.
